UCL recently launched the new Life Learning website along with a highly
successful search tool.

Our team worked with an external agency who designed the site (based upon our responsive framework Indigo) and worked closely with the site editors to assist in the content architecture.

My main responsibility in this project was putting together the search tool
(in the form of a single page application) which uses a REST API from our
enterprise search application and uses the JavaScript framework Backbone.js and
Underscore templating.
