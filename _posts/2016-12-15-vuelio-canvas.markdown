    I recently delivered a green field project for the company Access Intelligence
    marketed as the Vuelio Canvas built using Angular JS and a RESTful API.
    </p>
    <p>
    The application was placed on the landing for the PR application Vuelio and allows clients to create self curated pin boards containing snippets of content related to their organization from around the web.
    </p>
    <p>
    The application provides an admin UI to add the snippets and additional content types and also a public facing rendered board.
    </p>
    <p>
    'Canvas' also has the dual functionality of being able to serve as a newsroom.
