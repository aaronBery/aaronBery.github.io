    I worked with the UI team in providing a facelift to the legacy PR application. The main task was to make the product responsive and provide a complete change to the design.
    </p>
    <p>
    To make the web app responsive I used flexbox along with media queries. The application used a lot of floats in an inconsistent manner, so flexbox was a great candidate to solve the layout issue at the container/sidebar level.

      <img src="/assets/images/canvas-dashboard.png" alt="Vuelio Canvas" class="figure-img img-thumbnail"/>
      <figcaption class="figure-caption">Vuelio's new user interface.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </span>
</div>
