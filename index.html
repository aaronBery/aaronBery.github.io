      I am a front end developer at University College London who specializes in single page JavaScript applications and building well architected front end projects using task runners such as Grunt. I am currently working on a range of exciting technologies and applications that comprise the university's growing and evolving web presence. I also possess strong skills in SASS, CSS, XHTML with years of experience in a number of backend technologies such as CFML.

      I am the leading developer on UCL’s responsive framework Indigo that can be found publicly on Github, pioneering a number of the frameworks most valuable functionality along with key input on the configuration of the core architecture.
      </p><p>
      I have produced a number of single page applications using a variety of Javascript frameworks throughout my career. These include the University prospectus for Life Learning and the Institute of Education both written in Backbone JS. I am also in the process of completing the UCL Transport Institutes ‘Find an expert’ CRM integration which uses the framework Angular JS which also integrates with our researcher API.

      I’m currently spending my R&D time researching and experimenting with React Js and ECMAScript 2015 with a long term goal to implement both to in our future web apps.
